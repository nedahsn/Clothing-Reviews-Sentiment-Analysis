# Clothing-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project we work with Womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews data, and do sentiment analysis on the reviews to predict that the product has been recommended or not. 
We first do EDA, and then preprocess the data by preprocessing the reviews (text), oversampling the data (as the classes are unbalanced), and vectorization of the reviews (text).
We finally implement different ML (Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and DL models (LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM), 
and comapre their performance with different classification metrics to see which models gives us the best performance.
